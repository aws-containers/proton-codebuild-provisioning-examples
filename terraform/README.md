# Terraform Proton Examples

This directory is home to sample Terraform templates to gain an understanding of how one can leverage Terraform with AWS Proton via Codebuild provisioning.

## Bootstrap

Prior to running Terraform in Proton, you'll need a place to store Terraform state.  For the examples, you'll use an AWS S3 bucket for this purpose.

You can bring your own S3 bucket, or create one using the Terraform configuration located in the [boostrap](./bootstrap/README.md) directory.


## Examples

Example [environment](./environment-templates/README.md) and [service](./service-templates/README.md) templates under their respective directories.

Follow the [README](./environment-templates/vpc-ecs-cluster/README.md) [files](./service-templates/ecs-fargate-load-balanced-service/README.md) in the template directories for instructions on how to register them with AWS Proton.


## Contributing

These samples are configured to use the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) tool for running various checks before committing changes.  Please install the tool and run `pre-commit install` so that the automated checks are run before committing.  You can also run `pre-commit run --all-files` to run the checks on-demand.

The following additional tools need to be installed
