## Description

This template is the same as the [tf-ecs-fargate-lb-service](../../tf-ecs-fargate-lb-service/) but adds infrastructure to enable CI/CD using AWS CodePipeline.  The template outputs the following resources:

- Private ECR repository
- CodeBuild Project
- CodePipeline

The idea with this template is that once you deploy it, it will setup a CodePipeline that will automatically:

- build your code into a container image (requires a Dockerfile)
- push your image to ECR
- update your Proton service to deploy the image to the ECS service

This template is compatible with the [tf-vpc-ecs-cluster](../../environment-templates/tf-vpc-ecs-cluster) template.


## Register Template in AWS Proton

To register this template in AWS Proton, you can either use the GUI console, or you can run the `make template` command specifying an S3 bucket used to store the template bundle and the version you'd like to register.
